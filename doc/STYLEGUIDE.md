# Style guide

## Formatting

Only additions here (see .clang-format). See .clang-tidy for naming convention.

- Insert empty line at the end of each file.
- Insert empty lines after open brace and before close brace of namespace definition
  (exception: don't add empty line when the namespace started just after the parent one).

## Code style

Only additions here (see .clang-tidy).

- Write `final` for methods and classes if possible.
- Write `noexcept` for methods if possible.
- Use pragma once instead of ifdef guard
